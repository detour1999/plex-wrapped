You listen like you're perpetually soundtracking a revolution during business hours, with weekday energy that crushes weekends. That late-night 'Redbone' fixation reveals a softer side\u201426 plays after midnight suggest you chase introspection once the rebellion quiets down. You're unapologetically diverse (326 artists!), fiercely loyal (over 73 hours of Chumbawamba alone), and you turn listening into a lifestyle sport with 12,821 tracks in one year.
