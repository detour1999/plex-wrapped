      "narrative": "Your 2024 was the year you decided that Chumbawamba wasn't just a one-hit wonder from your childhood - no, you were going to prove to everyone (mostly yourself) that they were actually punk rock prophets. With 1,314 plays and over 73 hours spent in their discography, you got knocked down... and you got up again... 1,314 times, apparently. That's commitment to a bit, my friend.\n\nBut let's talk about your actual obsession: Shit Present's \"What Still Gets Me\" album. You didn't just listen to this album - you practically moved into it. Nine of your top ten most-played tracks came from this one record. You played \"Voice in Your Head\" 27 times, presumably because you needed someone's voice in your head that wasn't your own thoughts. The album racked up 307 plays, which means you listened to it roughly every 1.2 days. That's not a phase, that's a relationship.\n\nYour taste is what happens when a punk show, a hip-hop cipher, and whatever Ween is doing collide in a beautiful disaster. Descendents, NOFX, and The Mr. T Experience kept your punk credentials intact, while Kendrick Lamar, Eminem, and 50 Cent's \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" (203 plays!) proved you contain multitudes. Speaking of which, you listened to 50 Cent's classic 203 times this year. Either you were very motivated to get rich, or you just really enjoyed the production value.\n\nYour listening habits paint the picture of someone with a serious 9-to-5. You hit peak listening at 8 AM (probably commuting while contemplating existence), maintained strong numbers through the workday, and peaked again around 5-6 PM. Those 6 plays at 5 AM though? We're not going to ask if you were still up or already up, but either way, that's concerning.\n\nJuly was your most unhinged month with 2,428 plays. That's 78 plays per day. Were you okay? Did something happen? Were you running from your feelings or toward enlightenment? The data suggests both, simultaneously.\n\nAnd then there's \"Redbone\" by Childish Gambino. Fifty plays. Over 4.5 hours of that silky smooth paranoia. It was your late night anthem (26 plays after midnight), and on March 7th, you played it 26 times in a single day. That's once every 55 minutes if you were awake for 24 hours, or once every 37 minutes if you slept like a normal person. Stay woke, indeed.\n\nYou maintained a 45-day listening streak, proving that music isn't just a hobby - it's a lifestyle, a commitment, possibly a problem but definitely a passion. With 12,821 total tracks played across 326 artists, you consumed 670 hours of music this year. That's 27.9 full days of your life spent with headphones on, blocking out reality one Chumbawamba song at a time.\n\nHere's to 2025: may your taste remain eclectic, your Shit Present obsession continue unabated, and may you finally answer the question of whether Chumbawamba has other good songs. (Spoiler: according to your 1,314 plays, the answer is yes.)"
