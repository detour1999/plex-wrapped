      "narrative": "Let's be honest: 2024 was the year you became THAT NOFX person. You know, the one who played them 13,306 times while everyone else was discovering whatever was trending on TikTok. You spent over 31,000 minutes with Fat Mike and the gang, which is roughly 21 solid days of your life. Some people went on vacation. You went to punk rock summer camp and never left.\n\nYou listened to \"The Decline\" 108 times this year. That's 18 minutes and 8 seconds of political punk rock commentary... times 108. That's 33 hours of one song. You could have watched the entire Lord of the Rings extended trilogy twice and still had time left over. But no, you chose capitalism critique set to power chords, and honestly? Respect.\n\nYour dedication peaked on June 2nd when you played \"The Decline\" 18 times in a single day. EIGHTEEN TIMES. That's 5 hours and 24 minutes of the same song. Were you okay? Were you studying for a punk rock final exam? Did you lose a bet? Whatever happened that day, you clearly needed Fat Mike to explain socioeconomic collapse on repeat.\n\nBut NOFX wasn't your only obsession. Chumbawamba showed up with 3,225 plays, proving you appreciate both anarcho-punk manifestos AND getting knocked down (then getting up again). You also squeezed in 2,770 plays of Screeching Weasel, because apparently your musical palette is \"1990s punk rock or nothing.\"\n\n\"Linoleum\" was your anthem with 132 plays. You know every word, every guitar riff, every snotty vocal inflection. You probably dream in power chords at this point. And when it was late at night and the world was quiet, what did you reach for? \"Linoleum\" 43 times after midnight. It's like a lullaby, but for people who think moshing is a valid form of self-expression.\n\nYou pulled from 360 different albums but somehow 10 of your top albums were NOFX. Your number one album was literally called \"45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records,\" which you played 1,645 times. Even NOFX thinks these songs weren't good enough, but you? You gave them 42 hours of your life anyway. That's punk rock loyalty right there.\n\nYour listening pattern reveals you're either a night owl or a vampire. Peak listening at 1 AM? You racked up over 2,400 plays in the wee hours, probably annoying neighbors or concerning roommates. Mondays were your biggest day, which makes sense because nothing says \"I hate capitalism\" like starting your work week with bands that literally wrote songs about hating capitalism.\n\nYou maintained a 164-day listening streak. That's nearly half the year of consecutive punk rock. You woke up every single day for 164 days and thought, \"You know what I need? More power chords.\" And you were right.\n\nWith 30,642 total tracks played across just 74 artists, you're not exploring musical diversity so much as you're digging the deepest possible tunnel into one very specific genre. You listened to music for 78,488 minutes this year. That's 54 and a half days of pure audio. Most people use music as a soundtrack to their life. You used your life as an excuse to listen to more music.\n\nSo here's to 2024: the year you proved that you don't need algorithmic recommendations, carefully curated playlists, or trendy discoveries. You need Fat Mike yelling about politics, power chords at 180 BPM, and the unwavering belief that punk's not dead\u2014it's just being played on repeat in your headphones. Same time next year?"

Your commitment to NOFX is so intense that the other 74 artists in your library are basically just taking up space between NOFX albums. You peaked at 1 AM because that's when the existential dread hits and only Fat Mike's sarcasm can soothe you. You listened to one song 18 times in a single day, which is either dedication or a cry for help. Your 164-day listening streak suggests you'd rather give up water than give up punk rock.",

Your late-night anthem is 'Linoleum' at 1 AM, and you've achieved a 164-day listening streak that would make even Fat Mike nod in approval. Your musical soul lives in DIY basements, thrift store band tees, and the belief that the best songs are fast, furious, and sharply satirical. You don't just listen to punk\u2014you breathe it, sleep it, and probably argue about it at 2 AM. Your energy is a mosaic pit at a packed all-ages show: chaotic, communal, and gloriously uncompromising."
