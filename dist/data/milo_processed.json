      "narrative": "## Your 2024: A Punk Rock Odyssey (Mostly NOFX)\n\n**30,642 tracks. 1,308 hours. 74 artists.**\n\nLet's be real here: this wasn't a year of musical exploration. This was a year of *commitment*. Specifically, commitment to NOFX that borders on \"should we be concerned?\"\n\n### The NOFX Situation\n\nYou played NOFX **13,306 times**. That's 43% of everything you listened to. For perspective, you gave them 518 hours\u2014that's **21 full days** of Fat Mike's snarky vocals. Your second place artist, Chumbawamba, got a mere 3,225 plays. NOFX didn't just win\u2014they lapped the competition three times while doing a keg stand.\n\nYour top 10 tracks? **All NOFX.** Every. Single. One. You played \"Linoleum\" 132 times, which is somehow not even your most obsessive moment. That honor goes to June 2nd, when you played \"The Decline\" *18 times in one day*. That's **5 hours and 24 minutes** of the same 18-minute song. Were you okay? Did you lose a bet?\n\n### Your Album Collection (The NOFX Wing)\n\nYour top 10 albums? Take a wild guess. Yes, **10 for 10 NOFX**. You listened to \"45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records\" 1,645 times. The irony of making their B-sides your most-played album of the year is *chef's kiss*.\n\n### The 1 AM Punk Rock Philosophy Hour\n\nYour peak listening time was 1-2 AM, when you were most likely to fire up \"Linoleum\" (43 plays after midnight) and contemplate life's big questions. Like why Fat Mike wore that dress that one time. Or whether you've actually memorized all 18 minutes of \"The Decline.\" (Spoiler: you definitely have.)\n\n### The Other 56.6% of Your Year\n\nCredit where it's due: you *did* listen to other artists. Chumbawamba, Screeching Weasel, and The Dead Milkmen rounded out a very respectable 90s punk revival. You're basically a time capsule from 1994, and honestly? In 2024, that tracks.\n\nYou maintained a **164-day listening streak**, proving that whatever else happened this year\u2014good, bad, or weird\u2014there was always punk rock. Mostly NOFX. Okay, *overwhelmingly* NOFX.\n\n### The Final Tally\n\n74 unique artists across 3,039 unique tracks means you've got range... you just choose not to use it. And you know what? That's valid. When you find something that works\u2014whether it's a life partner, a breakfast routine, or a California punk band that broke up this year\u2014you commit.\n\n**2024: The year you said \"Fuck it\" to algorithms and played what you wanted. Over. And over. And over.**\n\nSee you in 2025, when we're all desperately curious if you'll find a new band or just keep playing \"Linoleum\" until the heat death of the universe. \ud83e\udd18"

You've got 74 artists in your library but let's be real, 73 of them are just emotional support bands for when NOFX needs a bathroom break. Your peak listening hour is 1 AM because nothing says 'healthy sleep schedule' like aggressive California punk at witching hour. You hit play on music 395 times in a single day\u2014that's not listening, that's a cry for help set to power chords. The most impressive part? You somehow found time to give Chumbawamba 3,225 plays.
