You're the type to start your workday at 8am sharp with Kendrick's introspection, hit peak productivity at 10am (704 plays don't lie), and somehow convinced yourself that listening to the same 3 songs on repeat is 'curating your vibe.' Your top 3 artists account for over half your listening time, which is either profound loyalty or a cry for help. You disappeared for most of 2024 until August hit and you had an existential crisis that only 'Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers' could solve. Weekends? Those are for casual listeners.

You chase that golden era sound (OutKast, N.W.A, MF DOOM, The Pharcyde) while staying locked into modern conscious rap. Your autumn awakening (that massive August-November spike) suggests you're seasonally inspired, using music as a meditative ritual during working hours. You're not just listening\u2014you're studying, reflecting, and finding spiritual resonance in beats and bars."
