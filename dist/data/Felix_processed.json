Your 10 AM listening peak suggests you treat workday mornings like a spiritual experience\u2014except your church is Kendrick's discography and Chance's Coloring Book is your hymnal. You somehow burned through 22% of your entire year listening to just three artists, which is less 'eclectic taste' and more 'hip-hop monogamy.' That one day you played 'All Night' 86 times? Therapy would be cheaper. You're out here treating Gorillaz's 'Plastic Beach' like a palate cleanser between Kendrick deep-dives, and that one Dead Milkmen track in your top 10 is doing absolutely zero to convince us you're not just a golden-age hip-hop head in denial.",

Your 10 AM peak listening reveals a soul that processes the world through rhythm before noon\u2014coffee in one hand, existential bars in the other. That 86-play day of 'All Night' wasn't obsession, it was transcendence. You don't just listen to music; you let it rewire your consciousness, one Gorillaz interlude at a time."
