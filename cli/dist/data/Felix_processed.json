      "narrative": "# Your 2024 Symphony of Chaos\n\nAlright, let's talk about your year. You pressed play **5,964 times** and racked up **375 hours** of listening time. That's basically 15.6 days straight of music. Did you even listen to silence this year, or is that concept foreign to you now?\n\n## The Kendrick Lamar Fan Club (Population: You)\n\nYou spent **85 hours** with Kendrick Lamar. EIGHTY-FIVE HOURS. That's more time than most people spend with their actual therapist. And judging by your obsession with \"Die Hard\" (146 plays) and \"Father Time\" (86 plays), you weren't just vibing\u2014you were *processing*. \"Rich (interlude)\" got 89 plays, and it's literally 1 minute and 43 seconds long. You okay, friend?\n\n## The Holy Trinity of Hip-Hop\n\nYour top three artists\u2014Kendrick, Chance the Rapper, and Ye\u2014occupied **197 hours** of your year. That's a whole college course worth of content, except instead of a degree, you got *feelings* and the ability to rap every word of \"No Problem.\"\n\nSpeaking of Chance: you played \"All Night\" **183 times**. And we know about that one day in September when you played it **86 times in 24 hours**. That's not listening, that's a spiritual experience. That's a cry for help. That's art.\n\n## The Plot Twist\n\nBut wait\u2014in the middle of all this hip-hop excellence, there's Gorillaz. You played \"To Binge\" 112 times like a melancholic indie kid hiding inside a hip-hop head's body. And somehow, \"I'm Flying Away\" by The Dead Milkmen snuck into your top 10? **85 plays?** The chaotic energy is strong with this one.\n\n## Your Listening Habits Are... Telling\n\nYou're a **10 AM warrior**. That's when you hit peak listening mode (704 plays that hour). Most people are barely through their first coffee, and you're already on your third spin of \"Blessings.\" Mondays were your biggest day\u2014apparently you *really* need music to survive the weekly existential dread.\n\nBut here's the real tea: you basically didn't listen to music for half the year. January, March, April, July? Ghost town. Then **August hit** and you remembered music exists, spiraling into a 4-month binge that peaked in **October** with 1,855 plays. What happened? New job? Breakup? Discovered headphones?\n\n## The Late Night Confession\n\nYour late-night anthem was \"Redbone\" by Childish Gambino (24 plays after midnight). Nothing says \"3 AM introspection\" quite like that falsetto. We see you, lying in the dark, questioning your life choices.\n\n## The Grand Finale\n\nYou maintained a **37-day listening streak** at some point. That's dedication. That's commitment. That's someone who understands that life without a soundtrack is just... existing.\n\n**Coloring Book** was your album of the year with 809 plays\u2014over 50 hours of Chance's gospel-rap glory. You weren't just listening; you were attending church.\n\nSo here's to 2024: the year you turned music into a lifestyle, Kendrick into a life coach, and \"All Night\" into your personality. Same time next year? \ud83c\udfb5"

Your 9-5 is really a 9-5 Kendrick marathon, with 22% of your entire year dedicated to the holy trinity of Kendrick, Chance, and Ye. You played 'All Night' 86 times in one day\u2014that's not a listening session, that's a religious experience. Your coworkers think you work from home, but really you're in a booth at the church of West Coast conscious rap, taking communion with MF DOOM and OutKast. Late nights belong to Childish Gambino's 'Redbone' (24 times past midnight because existential crises need a soundtrack).

The heavy rotation of 'All Night' and 'Die Hard' reveals someone who finds comfort in vulnerability and isn't afraid to sit with complex emotions. You're drawn to artists who challenge themselves and their listeners, favoring albums that demand multiple listens to fully unpack. Your musical spirit is equal parts consciousness and joy, forever seeking that balance between being woke and being blessed."
