      "narrative": "# Your 2024: A Musical Odyssey of Questionable Choices\n\nLet's address the elephant in the room: you spent **73 hours** listening to Chumbawamba in 2024. That's right\u2014while everyone else was having their tasteful Kendrick Lamar phase, you were out here getting knocked down (and getting up again) 1,314 times. Respect? Maybe. Concern? Definitely.\n\nYou crushed **12,821 tracks** this year, racking up over **670 hours** of listening time. That's basically a full month of your life. You could've learned Mandarin. Instead, you learned every Descendents song ever recorded (686 plays worth).\n\n## The Shit Present Situation\n\nSomewhere around mid-year, you discovered Shit Present's \"What Still Gets Me\" and decided to make it everyone's problem. You played this album 307 times. Your top 10 tracks? Nine of them are from this album. The only intruder? \"Redbone\" by Childish Gambino, which you played 50 times\u201426 of those AFTER MIDNIGHT. Were you okay? Are you okay now?\n\nActually, let's talk about March 7th. You listened to \"Redbone\" **26 times in one day**. That's not a vibe, that's a cry for help set to a funky bassline.\n\n## Your Personality Disorder (Musically Speaking)\n\nYour top artists are basically a fever dream: anarcho-punk legends, California skate punks, Kendrick Lamar (thank god, something critically acclaimed), and then... Eminem and 50 Cent? You played \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" 203 times. Somewhere between \"Tubthumping\" and \"In Da Club,\" your Spotify algorithm just gave up trying to understand you.\n\n## The Numbers Don't Lie (But They Do Judge)\n\n- **5,153 unique tracks** across 326 artists\n- Peak listening: **8 AM on Fridays** (work from home energy)\n- **45-day listening streak**\u2014someone's commitment issues don't extend to music\n- July was your MONTH with 2,428 plays. What happened? New job? Breakup? Just vibes?\n\nYou essentially maintained a diet of 90s punk, experimental noise, and Grammy-winning hip-hop, blended together like a smoothie nobody asked for.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nYou're the person who has Ween, NOFX, and The Mr. T Experience in their top 10, but also isn't afraid to blast Gorillaz's \"Demon Days\" 145 times. You're musically omnivorous, slightly unhinged, and honestly? The party playlist would be chaos, but we'd all stay.\n\nHere's to 2025: may it involve slightly fewer Chumbawamba plays and maybe, just maybe, some therapy to process whatever \"Redbone at 3 AM\" was really about. \ud83c\udf7b"

You listened to 'Redbone' 50 times (26 of those after midnight on a single day in March\u2014you good?). Your taste says 'I was definitely at Warped Tour' but also 'I respect lyrical genius,' bouncing from Descendents to Eminem like it's perfectly normal. You're either working through something deep or you've discovered the secret to happiness is just... never leaving 1997's punk scene except for strategic hip-hop breaks.",

Pure chaotic bliss. Your 45-day listening streak shows devotion that rivals any religious practice. You exist in the sweet spot between mosh pit and mixtape, where Kendrick's lyricism shares space with NOFX's snark, and Ween's weirdness feels perfectly at home. You're allergic to the mainstream but unafraid to let Eminem and 50 Cent crash the party. Your aura screams: 'I know what I like, I like it loud, and I'll play it until the algorithm breaks.'"
