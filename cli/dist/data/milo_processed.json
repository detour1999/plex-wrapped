      "narrative": "# Your 2024: A Punk Rock Odyssey (Mostly Featuring NOFX)\n\n## The Year You Basically Married Fat Mike\n\nLet's cut straight to it: You listened to **30,638 tracks** this year, and **13,306 of them were NOFX**. That's 43% of your entire year. You spent more time with Fat Mike than most people spend with their actual friends. You dedicated **518 hours** to NOFX alone \u2013 that's literally 21.5 days straight of punk rock bliss.\n\nYou played \"The Decline\" **108 times**. You know, that 18-minute epic? That's **33.9 hours** of your life committed to a single song. Some people binge-watch Netflix. You binge-listen to one track that's longer than most TV episodes.\n\n## The 1-2 AM Philosophy Hour\n\nYour peak listening hour was **1-2 AM** with 2,403 plays. While normal humans were sleeping, you were having your 43rd late-night encounter with \"Linoleum\" (your certified Late Night Anthem\u2122). There's something beautifully unhinged about blasting punk rock in the wee hours, and you committed to it **hard**.\n\n## That One Day in June\n\nOn June 2nd, 2025, something possessed you to play \"The Decline\" **18 times in one day**. That's 5.4 hours of the same song. Were you okay? Did you lose a bet? Were you trying to unlock some secret punk rock enlightenment? We may never know, but respect.\n\n## Your Supporting Cast\n\nChumbawamba came in at #2 with 3,225 plays, proving you appreciate bands that get knocked down but get up again (we all saw what you did there). Screeching Weasel, The Dead Milkmen, and Propagandhi rounded out your top 5, confirming that your music taste peaked somewhere in the mid-90s punk scene and you're absolutely fine with that.\n\n## The Summer Silence\n\nAugust 2024: **1 play**. ONE. What happened? Did you finally go outside? Did someone take your phone? Were you in witness protection? After months of 5,000+ plays, you basically went radio silent. Then September rolled around and you came roaring back with 887 plays like nothing happened.\n\n## The Completionist\n\nYou explored **360 unique albums** but kept returning home to \"45 or 46 Songs That Weren't Good Enough to Go on Our Other Records\" (1,645 plays). You literally preferred NOFX's reject pile to most other bands' greatest hits. That's either profound loyalty or Stockholm syndrome, and honestly, it's probably both.\n\n## The Verdict\n\nYou maintained a **164-day listening streak**, spinning tracks every single day for over five months. You averaged **84 tracks per day**. You listened to **1,309 hours** of music total. You are either the world's most dedicated punk rock archivist, a very patient person, or someone who really, *really* hates silence.\n\nIn 2024, while others were discovering new genres and expanding their horizons, you looked at NOFX's entire discography and said \"Yeah, this'll do.\" And you know what? That's punk as hell.\n\n**Your 2024 in three words:** Fat Mike Forever. \ud83c\udfb8"

Your crimson aura pulses with bratty humor, political snark, and the kind of DIY dedication that racks up 30,000+ plays without blinking. You don't just listen to punk\u2014you live in it, breathe it, and probably argue about it online.
